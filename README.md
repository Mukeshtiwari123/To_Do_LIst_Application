# To_Do_LIst_Application
**Create a simple and Effective GUI-Based To-Do List application in Java that allows users to manage their tasks. Users can add tasks, mark tasks as complete, view their tasks, and remove tasks from the list.****

Steps you can Implement:**

**1. User Interface:** Design a basic command-line interface that displays a menu of options
to the user, such as "Add Task," "Mark Task as Complete," "View Tasks," and "Exit."
**2. Task Data Structure:** Define a data structure (e.g., a class or struct) to represent a task,
including attributes like title, description, due date, and completion status.
**3. Task List:** Create a data structure (e.g., an ArrayList) to store the list of tasks.

**4.Add Task:** Implement a function that allows users to add tasks to the list. Collect task
details (title, description, due date) from the user.
**5. Mark Task as Complete:** Implement a function that allows users to mark tasks as
complete. Users should be able to select a task by its index in the list.
**6. View Tasks:** Create a function that displays the list of tasks with their details, including
the task's title, description, due date, and completion status.
**7. Remove Task:** Implement a function that allows users to remove tasks from the list.
Users should be able to select a task by its index in the list.
**8. Input Validation:** Implement input validation to handle errors gracefully, such as invalid
input values or out-of-range indices.
**9. Documentation:** Document your code with comments, explaining the purpose of
functions and variables. Include user instructions on how to use the To-Do List
application.
